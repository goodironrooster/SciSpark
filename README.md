## SciSpark

**SciSpark** is a system designed to enhance the creative and exploratory capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in scientific domains. It aims to help LLMs understand their limitations, identify underlying patterns, and generate novel ideas by leveraging various analysis and optimization techniques. This is in a very initial stage and just an curious experiment.

## Core Components

* **LLM Interface (`llm_interface.py`):** Provides an interface to interact with LLMs, send prompts, and receive responses.
* **Internal Voice (`internal_voice.py`):**  Analyzes LLM responses, provides critiques, and suggests improvements.
* **Advanced Internal Voice (`advanced_internal_voice.py`):**  Incorporates multiple perspectives (logical, creative, critical, practical) for a more comprehensive analysis.
* **Neural Shadow Optimizer (`neural_shadow_optimizer.py`):** Identifies novel ideas and "shadow patterns" within the LLM output, leading to creative extensions and new research directions.

## Analysis Tools

* **Shadow Detection (`shadow_detection.py`):** Identifies recurring patterns ("shadows") in the LLM output, which might indicate underlying biases or limitations.
* **Concept Mapper (`concept_mapper.py`):** Maps identified shadows to specific concepts, helping to understand the relationships between patterns and the ideas they represent.
* **Failure Detection (`failure_detection.py`):** Analyzes LLM responses for potential issues like factual errors, logical inconsistencies, toxicity, or irrelevant information.
* **Pattern Analyzer (`pattern_analyzer.py`):** Detects various types of patterns (repeating, sequential, structural, statistical) in the data.
* **Benchmark System (`benchmark_system.py`):** Tracks and evaluates the performance of the overall system and individual components.

## Supporting Modules

* **Buffer Manager (`buffer_manager.py`):** Manages an in-memory buffer to store and access LLM responses efficiently.
* **Stream Validator (`stream_validator.py`):** Validates the integrity and format of data streams within the system.

## Getting Started

0. **I don't know what I'm doing:** The code is crude, you need to change the directory of where your LLM is located:

test_llm.py   
run_optimizer.py   
test_advanced_voice.py   
test_integration.py   
test_internal_voice.py   
voicetest.py
Example:

If your LLM model is located at D:/LLM models/my_model.gguf, you would change the following line in the scripts:

Python
llm = LLMInterface(model_path="path/to/your/model") 

To:

Python
llm = LLMInterface(model_path="D:/LLM models/my_model.gguf")

Important notes:

If you're using a different LLM library or interface, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly to load your model correctly.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/SciSpark.git](https://github.com/your-username/SciSpark.git)
